d3.inlog
========

Understand what's going on under the hood of your monster d3 method chains.

Usage
=======
1. Include it: `<script type="text/javascript" src="https://raw.github.com/capitalist/d3.inlog/master/d3.inlog.js"></script>`
2. Enable it: `d3.inlog(true)`
3. Shut it back off: `d3.inlog(false)`

Example
=======
<div class="thumbnail"><a href="https://skitch.com/capitalist/ginma/area-chart"><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20111231-1kteq531u4fe4fk4w87j1nf7cy.preview.jpg" alt="Area Chart" /></a></div>

Warnings
=======
This sucker spews a lot of console messages. 
It will make your transitions choppy if you leave it on during transitions.

TODO
========
I just cranked this sucker out, but I like where it's going. I am going to root around in d3 and much more of its semantics to the console messages.

Want to see something specific? Open an issue.
